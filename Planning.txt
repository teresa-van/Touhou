Turns:
- Cards should not be draggable when it is not your turn.
   (Unless an event was fired and a graze or spell card can be played)
- Create some kind of turn indicator (next to player UI)
- 

UI:
- Add deck and discard pile: Card back image with deck size is sufficient.
   (Card front for discard pile)
- Message system at the top (Notifies when an event was fired and notifies whose turn it is at the start of a turn).

Incidents:
- Icon shown in top right corner (hovering icon will show the blown up card with details).
- Show (cards collected/cards required) if incidient requires collecting cards to be resolved.
- Effects can be added later on...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Events:
- Fired and appended to a stack (events are resolved in a last-in first-out fashion)
- Bombs are checked first as a reaction to any event
- Events that occur from attempting to resolve another event is appended to the stack and must be resolved first

Scenario:
shoot
graze ---> triggers another event (through passive effect of someone avoiding an attack)
passive used because a shoot was played ---> triggers another event
